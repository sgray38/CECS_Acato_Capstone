    "- RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.\n",
    "- It is a technique that combines retrieval of relevant document information with generative models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated responses.\n",
    "- RAG systems typically retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base or corpus and use them to inform the generation of responses.\n",

special hardware/environment needs for test planning, completes testing intake assessments (TIA) entrance criteria with project team collaboration, performs testing intake assessments, and performs T&E services.', 'OIT follows VIP Agile and software acquisition, configuration, and implementation (SACI) methodology for development and management of IT projects.\\nVIP is a Lean-Agile framework that provides efficient streamlining of activities within the VA enterprise and is designed to increase the delivery speed of high-quality and secure IT capabilities.\\nVIP methodologies are reviewed on a recurring basis and refinements are made as needed.\\nTMO stays abreast of all the latest changes to the VIP methodologies that is maintained in PAL (Process Asset Library).\\nMajor program SACI processes tend to align with standard VA OIT processes to include VIP, and may streamline, expand, augment, or customize those VIP processes to meet program needs.', 'IV&V Test Management Operations & Test Center engagement starts with gathering project data for the Testing Intake Assessment (TIA).\\nIn the case of OIT, the primary authoritative source for approved and budgeted projects is VA PARS.\\nWhen a new entry or new build on an existing entry are established, TMO engagement begins.\\nTMO evaluates the VIP Request (VIPR), data elements, and project artifacts to recommend TMO testing services.\\nDuring product/build start, TMO performs the Criticality Analysis and Risk Assessment (CARA) and recommends appropriate test services.\\nDuring the remainder of the project lifecycle, TMO monitors product and sprint backlogs in project repositories, with follow-on CARA’s performed and recommendations of further applicable testing services.\\nTMO conducts testing services in parallel with the project build.', 'TMO processes include reviewing the project artifacts, conducting an initial outreach meeting, project analysis, planning, and testing service determination.\\nWhen the services start, TMO determines whether test environments exist which could be used for the services, or new ones are built.\\nFrom there, TMO executes testing, and generates reports of the test findings.\\nTMO also may conduct final regression testing following a project’s Initial Operating Capability (IOC).\\nTMO continues to monitor product and sprint backlogs until project closeout.', \"There are two primary entrances into TMO testing service engagement with a Program and/or Project.\\nOne is through a Program and/or Project entering a request into TMO’s centralized request management tool for testing services.\\nThe other is a proactive approach to monitoring the authoritative source for approved VA projects, both for new entries and software builds within existing entries.\\nTMO engages with the VA project manager (PM) or designee to gain access to the product teams repositories.\\nTMO conducts a high-level evaluation on all the artifacts.\\nAfter the evaluation, if further engagement is not recommended, TMO enters a passive engagement.\\nIf TMO\\\\'s engagement is recommended, a build-level risk assessment following TMO’s CARA process is conducted.\\nTMO recommended services accepted and scheduled with the project are performed against the current build and sprint based on the build-level CARA at the discretion of the project or

there are no additional builds, at which point TMO enters a passive engagement.\", 'For all VIP methodologies, TMO uses a risk-based approach to determine what T&E services are recommended.\\nThis approach involves using a standardized methodology to determine the level of testing for software applications based on risks and their probable adverse impacts to the enterprise.\\nAs part of the TIA process, the CARA methodology identifies the functions, system design elements, or software tasks which pose the greatest risk to the success of software development initiatives.\\nThe key feature of this approach is the assessment of an appropriate level of analysis for any given function based on risk and criticality.\\nBy applying CARA, suitable levels of analysis, as well as the resources
