Conservation Mission Area \nThe Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area is USDA\u2019s focal point for the nation\u2019s \nconservationists, farmers, ranchers, producers, forest landowners, as well as federal, state, local, tribal, and \nprivate partners, to seek assistance with crop insurance, conservation programs and technical assistance, \ncommodity lending, and disaster programs. FPAC has over 26,000 employees working in 2,200 o\ufb03ces located \nthroughout the \ufb01fty (50) States, American Samoa, Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  \nThe FPAC mission area includes four agencies: the Farm Services Agency (FSA), the Natural Resources \nConservation Service (NRCS), the Risk Management Agency (RMA), and the FPAC Business Center (FBC). \nNRCS provides leadership in a partnership e\ufb00ort to help America's private landowners and managers. NRCS and \nits predecessor agencies have worked in close partnerships with farmers and ranchers, local and state \ngovernments, tribes, and other federal agencies to maintain healthy and productive working landscapes. NRCS \nworks voluntarily with its partners to conserve their soil, water, air, plants, animals, and other natural resources \nby providing \ufb01nancial and technical assistance based on sound science and suited to a customer's speci\ufb01c needs. \nFBC provides mission area-wide administrative functions including information management, \ufb01nancial \nmanagement, human resources, acquisition management, customer experience guidance, managed services, \nand more.  The Assistant Chief Information O\ufb03cer for FPAC oversees all FPAC information technology services \nthrough the Information Solutions Division (ISD).  The Assistant Chief Data O\ufb03cer for FPAC oversees all FPAC data \ngovernance, management, and use.   \n1.2 NRCS Organization and Vision \nNRCS contains seven major lines of business which can be aligned to the NRCS organizational structure of four \ndeputy areas. \nTable 1. NRCS Lines of Business. \nLine of Business Deputy Area (organizational) \nConservation Planning and Technical Assistance Programs \nConservation Implementation (Farm Bill Programs) Programs \nLandscape-Level Resources Inventory Soils Survey and Resource Assessment \nLandscape-Level Resources Assessment Soils Survey and Resource Assessment \nSnow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting Soils Survey and Resource Assessment \nNatural Resources Technology Transfer Science and Technology \nConservation Operations Management and Strategy \nEach Deputy Area has its own unique set of deliverables and products which can focus on internal and external \ncustomers including but not limited to farmers and ranchers, local and state governments, tribes, other federal \nagencies, universities, NGOs and internal NRCS sta\ufb00. \nWithin each line of business, NRCS has a variety of programs, at a variety of scales (e.g. \ufb01eld-level or landscape), \nthat it uses to help deliver its mission. Many of the programs provide a specialized technical service, data, \nconservation product, and/or conservation practice to help support Farm Bill Programs. Farm Bill Programs are \nused to provide \ufb01nancial incentives to customers that: (1) help defer the costs associated with implementing one \nor more conservation practices, (2) help provide incentives to continue with or enhance existing conservation \nactives, or (3) help purchase conservation easements. \n1.2.1 NRCS Programs \n1.2.1.1 Background \nThe Programs Deputy Area includes three divisions. The Financial Assistance Programs Division is responsible for \ndeveloping policy and implementing \ufb01nancial assistance-focused programs. The Easements Programs Division is \nresponsible for developing policy and implementing easement-focused programs and reporting the count and \ncondition of the Agency\u2019s stewardship lands. Conservation Planning and Technical Assistance Division is \nresponsible for developing policy and implementing conservation technical assistance. This involves conservation \nplanning and all the technical \ufb01eld-level assistance including implementation of conservation programs and \npractices at the \ufb01eld-level. Conservation planning involves a nine-step process which mirrors a basic problem-\nsolving approach. The primary customers for these divisions are farmers and ranchers. NRCS State, Area, and \nField-level sta\ufb00 implement the various programs supported by these divisions. \n1.2.1.2 Vision \nLanguage from the 2018 Farm Bill charged NRCS to continue streamlining and integrating its Farm Bill Programs \nbusiness processes. Thus, NRCS currently is transitioning processes, policies and supporting software applications \nto meet these expectations. In March 2020, NRCS deprecated its legacy conservation planning software \n(Customer Service Toolkit) and replaced it with Conservation Desktop (CD). CD is an integrated system that \nallows users to seamlessly access a customer\u2019s technical and \ufb01nancial assistance data including geospatial, \ntabular, electronic documents/content, and electronic signatures. \nIn 2018, NRCS also initiated the idea of program neutral resource assessments and ranking. To help facilitate \nthese processes, NRCS developed and deployed the Conservation Assessment Ranking Tool (CART) in January \n2020. CART was designed to collect inventory data and assess a potential conservation plan based on the \nresource assessment results. CART determines the assessment\u2019s Farm Bill Program eligibility. At that time, a \nclient would select the \ufb01nancial assistance program(s) they may want to apply for and a scoring and ranking of \nthat assessment is conducted in CART. A system named ProTracts currently handles most of the application and \n\ufb01nancial assistance contracting part of the business process. \nNRCS plans to continue its integration e\ufb00orts between CD and CART along with migrating the application and \ncontract management functionality from ProTracts to CD. This will include additional enhancements to CD and \nCART to incorporate the automation of its environmental evaluation process which is required when creating \nconservation plans. NRCS will leverage the data being collected in CART and CD to begin reporting conservation \noutcomes and e\ufb00ects. NRCS plans to incorporate its easements data from the current National Easements \nStaging Tool (NEST) into CD and implement additional functionality needed to support easement acquisition and \nmonitoring. Another part of the future vision for NRCS is to leverage mobile data collection that integrates with \nCD. Additionally, NRCS plans to continue CD\u2019s integration with its customer-facing web portal Farmers.gov. In the \nfuture, clients will be able to submit online requests for conservation assistance, submit electronic documents, \nelectronically sign documents, and receive noti\ufb01cations from various applications that are part of CD. \nNRCS also is accelerating into its long-term vision for geospatial conservation data. Conservation Geo is ramping \nup to support NRCS data quality, data governance, and data delivery processes and support the states and \nleadership with authoritative data. The partnership between Conservation Geo and the Dynamic Soils Hub \nprovides a solid foundation and pathway for NRCS to achieve its long-term goals for high-quality decision support \nfor conservation and compliance with the Geospatial Data Act of 2018. \n1.2.2 NRCS Soil Science and Resource Assessment \n1.2.2.1 Background \nSoil Science and Resource Assessment (SSRA) helps answer the important questions that strengthen NRCS\u2019s \nvoluntary conservation delivery by collecting and analyzing data and developing tools critical to conservation \nplanning. While conservationists work with agricultural producers and conservation partners to draft \nconservation plans and implement conservation practices, SSRA sta\ufb00 works with members of academia, \nresearchers, and other science partners to provide mission-critical data, \ufb01ndings, and other information to \nsupport science-based, data-driven conservation. Across customer groups and geographic scales, NRCS\u2019 SSRA \nDeputy Area \u2014 including the Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD), National Water and Climate Center (NWCC), \nand Resource Inventory and Assessment Division (RIAD) \u2014 plays an integral role in NRCS\u2019s approach to \nconservation. SSRA has more than 600 sta\ufb00 nationwide.  \nWithin the SSRA Deputy Area there are two divisions: Resource Inventory and Assessment Division and Soils and \nPlant Science Division. The SSRA Deputy Area also has operational control over the National Water and Climate \nCenter (NWCC). The Resource Inventory and Assessment Division is responsible for conducting the National \nResources Inventory which as a program collects and produces scienti\ufb01cally credible information on the status, \ncondition, and trends of land, soil, water, and related resources on the Nation's non-federal lands. The division is \nalso responsible for conducting assessments and modeling of conservation e\ufb00orts to determine outcomes and \ne\ufb00ects of NRCS\u2019 conservation activities. \nThe Soils and Plant Science Division is responsible for the inventory and analysis of soil and plant resources \nthroughout the United States. They map soils and provide geospatial soils information along with detailed \ninformation about the physical and chemical properties of soils. The Division is also responsible for the collection \nof plant related data. The NWCC is responsible for providing data collection and water supply forecasts for a \nvariety of purposes (e.g. hydroelectric dam operations, reservoir management and drought assessment). The \nNational Plant Data Team, physically located at the East National Technology Center (ENTC), provides national \nand international leadership on plant information for the United States. The Team acquires, develops, and \ndisseminates plant information to support USDA, NRCS, and other e\ufb00orts to improve the ecological health of the \nland. The Team maintains the PLANTS Database to support a variety of conservation activities. \nThe SSRA Deputy Area works closely with FPAC-BC ISD Geospatial Enterprise Operations (GEO) as there is a \ngeospatial component with almost every SSRA Deputy Area IT product.  ISD GEO is responsible for technical \nleadership and expertise in geosciences: mapping science, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), \naerial photography, remote sensing, and global position systems (GPS), elevation and imagery data, natural \nresources data, and geospatial technology. The various divisions within the SSRA Deputy Area service a vast \ncustomer base including individual farmers and ranchers, NRCS sta\ufb00, universities, industry, federal, state, and \nlocal agencies, non-governmental organizations, congress, tribes, and the non-farming community. \n1.2.2.2 Vision \nGoing into the future, the SSRA Deputy Area intends to modernize and maximize automation for soil, plants, and \necological sites resource inventory supporting tools to enhance the customer services through adaptable, \ne\ufb03cient, scalable technical solutions to streamline processes to free up resources for mission critical work. It also \nintends to eliminate the risks associated with outdated technology to increase e\ufb03ciency, data integrity, quality, \nand availability. Integrating and automating data with other business processes, especially the conservation \ndelivery process is a major priority as well.  \nThe Dynamic Soils Hub (DS Hub) under the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is an innovative \nplatform designed for authoritative soil geospatial modeling. It aims to provide tools and data for both internal \nand external partners and stakeholders, enabling high-performance geospatial modeling and terrain analysis. \nThe DS Hub connects soil and conservation databases, allowing for the assessment of environmental bene\ufb01ts in \nconservation programs by accessing previously siloed data and models across Agency divisions. This expands the \nUSDA\u2019s capacity to model and report on soil properties that change with conservation management over time. \nKey features of the DS Hub include: \n\u2022 Access to both external and internal authoritative data sources and soils data for robust soil modeling. \n\u2022 An innovative geospatial data user interface specializing in unique terrain analysis, enabling users to \ncreate new data products from a variety of existing authoritative datasets. \n\u2022 No-code processing of large data volumes for geospatial modeling, unlike current tools and work\ufb02ows. \n\u2022 Collaboration tools for modelers to work on projects, share data and experiments, and produce scienti\ufb01c \nmodels and datasets. \n\u2022 Enhanced USDA capacity to model and report on soil properties that change with conservation \nmanagement. \n\u2022 Facilitation of the collection, storage, and delivery of data related to dynamic soil properties and \nconservation management. \n\u2022 A focus on rapidly responding to customer requests for science-based soil property data at the Deputy \nChief, Chief, and Undersecretary levels. \nThe Soil Business Systems Branch intends to modernize and integrate their information systems to meet \ncustomers' needs, mission requirements, and to support putting conservation on the ground. Within the same \ntimeframe, the Branch intends to adapt new technologies and applications to address emerging trends in soil \nand plant sciences. The Ecological Sites Branch intends to have the Ecosystems Dynamic Interpretative Tool \n(EDIT) program within the family of the soil and plants information systems, integrating it with other \nconservation programs support tools. \nThe National Plant Data Team plans to modernize its PLANTS database and website to include a dynamic content \nmanager as well, as increasing the processing and delivery of information to our customers. The team is planning \nto upload the multi-year backlog of plants data and develop and implement product delivery metrics.  \nThe Soil Survey Research and Laboratory intends to improve the management of laboratory data systems and \nleverage improvements of the soil and plants data systems to use the combined information in streamlined \ninventory delivery. \nThe Soil Surveys Standards Team intends to evolve training methods to support new technologies, products, and \nprocesses in support of natural resources inventory and conservation. They are also planning to develop and \nmaintain scienti\ufb01c world-wide natural resources inventory standards to support conservation that is fact-based, \ndata-driven, science-based, and customer focused. \nIn addition, the Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting Program intends to increase the time spent on \ninterpretation of collected, aggregated, and ingested telemetry data and decrease the time spent on work-\naround processes, as well as a reduction in the reliance on outdated and aging enabling technology so that the \nprogram provides better decision-support products to our conservationists, farmers, ranchers, producers, as well \nas federal, state, local, tribal, and private partners. They also plan to eliminate the risks associated with aging and \noutdated technology to increase e\ufb03ciency, data integrity, quality, and availability along with modernizing the \ntechnologies needed to improve forecasting and business analysis process, accuracy, reliability, and availability. \nThe Resource Inventory and Assessment Division (RIAD) is planning to integrate some of the currently external \napplications with existing NRCS databases and systems. For example, updates and integrations are planned for \nthe Rangeland Brush Estimation Toolbox (RaBET) so they can complete data updates to all 39 NRCS Major Land \nResources over the next \ufb01ve years. RIAD will continue to utilize the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) to help \nimprove Conservation E\ufb00ects Assessment Project (CEAP) modeling e\ufb00orts by adding additional geospatial layers. \nRIAD is planning for enhancements to the Soil and Water Resource Conservation Act (RCA) web-based dashboard \nand appraisal reports solution used to provide broad natural resource strategic assessments to Congress. \nThe FPAC GEO supports the SSRA deputy area in several ways.  GEO\u2019s future e\ufb00orts focus on the modernization \nof the Geospatial Data Gateway (GDG) while continuing to maintain the current version.  which is the One Stop \nSource for environmental and natural resource data, at any time, from anywhere, to anyone. This service is made \navailable through a close partnership between the three USDA Service Center Agencies (SCA): NRCS, FSA, and \nRural Development (RD). Planning is underway for the cloud-based, FEDRAMP certi\ufb01ed replacement of this \nlegacy solution.  \nGEO has begun migration to Amazon Web Services (AWS) where they will continue to provide support for the \ndata and resources of the   authoritative data marts including the Resource Data Gateway (or its replacement), \nGeospatial Services, High Resolution Elevation Data Mart, and Remote Sensing Data Mart. The current migration \nto AWS will continue to provide for the information lifecycle management of geospatial data used in NRCS \nagency programs, as well as programs within FSA and RD. \nGEO also plans to focus on the High-Resolution Elevation Data Mart which provides visualization and analysis for \nhigh resolution elevation data along with the provisioning of derivative elevation products and services for use in \nconservation planning and design, environmental assessment, and terrain mapping activities. Finally, GEO also \nneeds to continue maintaining and improving the Remote Sensing Data Mart (RSDM) and Remote Sensing Lab \nFile Management System, a web portal and \ufb01le management system for accessing remote sensing data. The \nRSDM\u2019s and RSLFMS\u2019s primary functions are to support the geospatial needs of the National Resources Inventory \nprogram. It also provides for the access of remotely sensed imagery and data supporting other program areas \nsuch as the Wetland Reserve Program. \n1.2.3 NRCS Science and Technology \n1.2.3.1 Background \nWithin the Science and Technology (S&T) Deputy Area there are three divisions: Conservation Engineering \nDivision, Ecological Sciences Division, and Soil Health Division. The S&T Deputy Area also maintains operational \ncontrol over \ufb01ve centers including: National Water Management Center, East National Technology Support \nCenter (ENTSC), Central National Technology Support Center (CNTSC), the West National Technology Support \nCenter (WNTSC), and National Design, Construction and Soil Mechanics Center. \nThe Conservation Engineering Division is responsible for creating, maintaining, and disseminating all \nengineering-related policy, technical design standards, and engineering speci\ufb01cations for NRCS conservation \npractices. The Ecological Sciences Division is responsible for providing and disseminating technical expertise and \ninformation related to grazing, biology, wildlife, water quality, nutrient management, invasive plant species, \nconservation compliance, forestry, agronomy, rangeland, air quality, and energy. They also are responsible for the \ntechnical design speci\ufb01cations for NRCS non-engineering related conservation practices. The Soil Health Division \nis responsible for maintaining technical expertise, providing support, and disseminating technical information \nregarding soil health (i.e. the capacity of the soil to function as a living ecosystem). \nThe National Water Management Center is responsible for the application of hydrology and hydraulics to all \nNRCS programs. It provides direct assistance, the latest technology transfer and delivery, direct technical \nassistance, water resources planning, watershed policy implementation, and program support with an emphasis \non consultation and training of State personnel. The National Design, Construction and Soil Mechanics Center \nprovides technical support for design, construction, operation, and rehabilitation of complex engineering \nprojects essential to resource conservation, environmental enhancement, and agricultural productivity. \nThe ENTSC is responsible providing direct conservation technology transfer to NRCS state and \ufb01eld sta\ufb00 for the \neastern portion of the United States. The center is also home to two national teams: National Animal Manure \nand Nutrient Management Team and National Plants Data Team. The National Animal Manure and Nutrient \nManagement Team provides livestock, manure management, and nutrient management research \ufb01ndings, \nproject updates, and information to sta\ufb00 and partners. It also evaluates new technology for manure handling, \nnutrient management, land application, and alternative manure use. The Team integrates current research and \ndevelopment into tools and practices for delivering assistance to livestock and other producers.  \nThe CNTSC is responsible for providing direct conservation technology transfer to NRCS state and \ufb01eld sta\ufb00 for \nthe central portion of the United States. The center is also home to the National Grazing Lands Team responsible \nfor providing national technical leadership for ecologically based technology development in all areas of grazing \nlands management and conservation. In addition, the center is nationally responsible for providing technical \nleadership for wetlands and wildlife. \nThe WNTSC is responsible for providing direct conservation technology transfer to NRCS state and \ufb01eld sta\ufb00 for \nthe western portion of the United States. The center is home to the National Energy Team, National Air Quality \nand Atmospheric Change Team and the National Water Quality and Quantity Team. The Energy Team develops \nand delivers information and technology that addresses energy conservation in agricultural systems and natural \nresource issues related to the production, utilization, and management of renewable energy sources such as \nbiofuels, solar, and wind. The Air Quality and Atmospheric Change Technology Development Team works with \nNRCS specialists and policymakers, as well as other Federal, State, University, and private organizations to \nprovide agricultural air quality technology and information to NRCS personnel, NRCS partners, and the public. \nThe Water Quality and Quantity Team develops and delivers cutting edge tools and training to address natural \nresource concerns related to hydrology and hydraulics, nutrient management, pest management, soil erosion, \nirrigation water management, agricultural drainage, salinity, and stream restoration. \n1.2.3.2 Vision \nCurrently, the S&T Deputy Area maintains over 110 di\ufb00erent software applications to perform various technical \nassessments, designs, and provide technical information. Many of these applications were developed many years \nago and may re\ufb02ect older technical techniques and assessment calculations. Moving into the future, e\ufb00orts will \nbe made to modernize, enhance, and (in some cases) integrate these applications with one another or \nconservation planning systems. \nThe S&T Deputy Area is seeking to develop and maintain technical excellence within the agency to acquire, \ndeliver, develop, and identify science and technology to provide world-class technical assistance to both internal \nand external customers. To accomplish this, NRCS will: (1) maintain science-based practice standards; (2) identify, \nanalyze, and integrate new science and technology into practice standards; (3) develop and maintain resource \nconcerns; (4) provide current up-to-date technology, tools, and technology transfer methods; and (5) reduce \ndependency on operating systems. \nNRCS plans to improve conservation technical assistance process e\ufb03ciency while emphasizing quality outcomes \nthrough analysis of enterprise relationships, process and technology interdependencies, practice utilization, and \nexisting as well as emerging automation enablers. To achieve this NRCS is planning to integrate Job Approval \nAuthority and certi\ufb01ed conservation planner status into Conservation Desktop and manage payment schedule \ninformation. \nGoing into the future, NRCS wants to maintain an understanding of and connection with S&T and USDA \ncustomers, both internal and external, and identify their needs to ensure proper alignment of services, service \ndelivery methods, and technology to achieve agency goals. To accomplish this, NRCS will: (1) integrate science-\nbased and economic information into programmatic payment schedules; (2) complete resource inventory and \nassessment for each resource concern, as they are relevant to the customer; and (3) generate implementation \nrequirements for all conservation practices scheduled in conservation plans. \nNRCS also is planning to become information rich through the collection and delivery of science and data from \nauthoritative sources, observation of the land, analysis of resource data, and dissemination of information \nthrough multiple channels. To accomplish this, NRCS plans to: (1) provision geospatial datasets that identify areas \nwith signi\ufb01cant resource concern occurrence by characterization of terrain, hydrology and vegetation \nphenomena derived from high resolution elevation and imagery derivatives; (2) provide pre-built geospatial \ninformation to locate opportunities for conservation practice application that are based on analysis of terrain, \nhydrology, soils, and land use history; and (3) be able to conduct automated and manual analysis for resource \ninventory, assessment, and implementation requirements in both o\ufb03ce and on-site work environments. \nAs part of its future vision, S&T Deputy Area wants to assess and manage natural resource information and \nnatural resource technology to meet strategic objectives, agency accountability requirements, and program \nrequirements while minimizing agency costs. Achieving these goals will require NRCS to: (1) keep information on \ndams and watershed projects; (2) maintain technical information associated with conservation activities and \nTechnical Service Provider requirements with transparency to the public; and (3) provide transparency to the \npublic and internal access to all technical references, resources, and data used by NRCS \ufb01eld employees for \nconservation planning e\ufb00orts. \nPart of NRCS\u2019 congressional mandates include maintaining a national inventory of NRCS-assisted dams as well as \nadditional NRCS watershed program data. The database contains approximately 29,000 dams. NRCS is also \nrequired to maintain and submit to the Army Corp of Engineers (on a bi-annual basis) dams inventory data for all \ndams meeting the inventory requirements. To accomplish this, NRCS will continue to maintain and (when \nnecessary) enhance its dam inventory application. \nMoving into the future, NRCS needs to e\ufb00ectively track highly erodible land and wetland compliance (HELC/WC) \ndetermination requests from start to \ufb01nish, including automated integrated work\ufb02ows with its sister agency, FSA. \nThis will require NRCS to have the ability to: (1) consistently record wetland determination boundaries in a \nnational geodatabase; (2) consistently record past wetland determinations in a geodatabase with a link to stored \ndocuments to prevent duplication of work; (3) make HELC/WC information readily viewable to NRCS in client \ninterface; and (4) record results of HELC/WC compliance \ufb01eld reviews. \nNRCS\u2019 future vision also includes integrated geospatial data resources that inform National Environmental \nProtection Act (NEPA), National Historic Protection Act (NHPA), and Endangered Species Act (ESA) compliance on \nconservation activities and providing conservation practices that would otherwise be acquired through state \nlevel agreements, nationally into NRCS conservation planning software. To complete this, NRCS plans to: (1) \nenable \ufb02exibility for state modi\ufb01cations to meet di\ufb00erent state agency requirements and data availability; (2) \ndevelop base geospatial data to help automate environmental evaluation activities; (3) develop a national-level \nagreement with all state historical preservation o\ufb03ces (SHPOs) to assist with more standardized and timely \naccess to SHPO data/consultation; and (4) develop a national agreement with US Fish and Wildlife Service to \nimprove access to their authoritative ESA datasets and web services. \nFinally, the S&T Deputy Area also wants to provide transparency to the public on \ufb01ndings from innovative \nprojects and new technologies (e.g. Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) on-farm trials, soil health demos and \nRegional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)). To do this, NRCS needs a back-end management and \ncustomer-facing portal for searching and data entry. The portal would provide links to references and data stores \nthat NRCS currently maintains on resource information, e\ufb00ects of conservation activities, and practice \nimplementation data. \n1.2.4 NRCS Management and Strategy \n1.2.4.1 Background \nThe Management and Strategy Deputy Area (M&S) plays a key role of support to the NRCS workforce by \nensuring the NRCS workforce can perform both operationally and technically. The M&S Deputy Area \ncontains seven divisions: Appropriations & Allocations Division, Business Resources Management \nDivision, International Programs Division, Operations Support Division, Outreach & Partnerships Division, \nPolicy & Accountability Division, and Technical Training & Development Division.", "The Appropriations & Allocations Division manages the agency budget in coordination with the FPAC \nBusiness Center.", "The Appropriations & Allocations Division manages the agency budget in coordination with the FPAC \nBusiness Center. The Appropriations & Allocations Division manages the agency budget in coordination with the FPAC \nBusiness Center. The Appropriations & Allocations Division manages the agency budget in coordination with the FPAC \nBusiness Center. The Business Resource Management Division provides mission support services through human capital \nplanning & management, strategic planning, data analytics, project management, and process analysis. \nThe Division will also serve as a coordinating function within the Management and Strategy Deputy Area \nfunctions as well as across Deputy Areas in NRCS.", "The International Programs Division provides mission critical coordination of global conservation and \ntechnical assistance.  \nThe Operations Division provides advisement and management of operational support services, including \nlogistical and infrastructure support. \nThe Outreach and Partnerships Division works within NRCS to provide mission critical guidance and \nsupport to staff at all levels supporting outreach and partnership activities. The division provides \nconsistent outreach guidance for the agency through support to state outreach, partnerships staff, and \nmanagement of cooperative agreements. \nThe Policy and Accountability Division provides oversight for the development of agency policy across all \ndeputy areas and states. This includes providing highly complex analysis to ensure the agency policy \nremains current and in alignment with statute and regulation. \nThe Technical Training and Development Division provides mission critical developmental needs to the \nagency\u2019s workforce. The division is responsible for providing comprehensive, specialized, and timely \ntraining programs that enhance the technical competence of the NRCS workforce that leads to improved \nservice delivery. \n1.2.4.2 Vision \nGoing into the future, the M&S Deputy Area intends to focus on the implementation of a new Mission Support \nProject Management system that would improve process management by implementing functionality that: (1) \nprocesses intake requests, (2) automates common work\ufb02ows and tasks, (3) stores and manages documents, (4) \nmonitors deadlines, (5) provides reporting capabilities, and (6) interfaces with existing tools. The system will \nleverage the latest project management technologies available to enable sta\ufb00 to focus on analysis, integration, \nprocess improvement, collaboration, and other complex tasks.  \nAdditional NRCS business processes this technology could improve includes funds veri\ufb01cation, data call \nadministration, decision tracking, operating budgets, records management, public-facing webpages such as \neDirectives, and quality control. Future functionality could also impact initiative requests and approvals, tracking \ninitiative outcomes, contracts, conferences, meetings, travel, working capital funds, suspension, and debarment, \ntracking for certi\ufb01cation of budget reporting, training, and human resources.", "M&S is also focused on the National O\ufb03ce Information System (NOIS).  The goal of NOIS is the development and \nimplementation of a comprehensive, enterprise-wide authoritative national o\ufb03ce information system, linked to \nother FPAC mission area-wide authoritative sources of operational and programmatic data, to facilitate the more \ne\ufb00ective and e\ufb03cient mission support, thereby optimizing service to our internal and external customers.  \nM&S will provide comprehensive, specialized, and timely training programs/tools that enhance the technical \ncompetence of the NRCS workforce that leads to improved service delivery. Career Planner will be one of these \ntools.  A career planner is an interactive training plan that details the tasks that an employee needs to \naccomplish to do their job successfully. It is designed to help employees identify what training is needed in their \ncurrent grade level and as they continue with their career at NRCS. NRCS will use the career planner for training \nand development purposes to add consistency and structure to training across the organization. Because career \nplanners set standard expectations, they are an excellent starting point for painting a picture of the expected \nknowledge, skills, and abilities of the workforce. This provides employees with target competencies and \nbehaviors across the range of pro\ufb01ciency levels for training and developmental experiences. \nFinally, NRCS needs to update critical mission delivery systems to support digital records management along with \nmaking select document management UI/UX enhancements. To support the document management e\ufb00ort, \nthere is integration work that is needed to support many NRCS applications including but not limited to the \nfollowing systems:  Programs Portal, DamWatch, Field O\ufb03ce Tech Guide (FOTG), Conservation Practice \nDocuments \u2013 Document Management System (CPD-DMS), National Easement Staging Tool (NEST), National \nEngineering Tool Suite (NETS), WinPond,  Conservation Desktop \u2013 Document Management System (CD-DMS), \nProTracts, Guardian and Farmers.gov.   \n1.2.5 Value Streams \nNRCS has a variety of programs, products, and customers. NRCS programs\u2019 functionality, databases, and systems \nalign to NRCS Value Streams. Each value stream represents the series of steps used to implement work and \nprovide a continuous \ufb02ow of value to NRCS. An NRCS information technology capital investment may contain one \nor more value streams.  The current NRCS Value Streams are: \n1. Core Natural Resource Information Systems \u2013 Functionality to support the integration of science models and \ndevelopment of resource databases; and systems that collect, analyze, and deliver data and information that \ncontribute to the success of all internal agency and public natural resources programs. This generally aligns \nwith the Soil Science and Resource Assessment Deputy Area. \n2. Water and Climate Information Systems - Functionality, databases, and systems needed to provide water, \nsnow, and climate monitoring data, collection and predictions, forecasts, and products.  This generally aligns \nwith the Soil Science and Resource Assessment Deputy Area. \n3. Conservation Practice Implementation - Tools and systems needed for developing Component Plans (e.g., \nNutrient Management Plan, Forest Management Plan, etc.), and Conservation Practice Implementation \nRequirements, Designs, and Checkout. This generally aligns with the Science and Technology Deputy Area. \n4. Conservation Plan and Compliance Information - Functionality, databases and systems needed to work with \nclients to develop a basic conservation plan.  Including steps 1-7 of the conservation planning process. This \naligns with the Programs Deputy Area. \n5.

This aligns with the Programs Deputy Area. \n6. Operational Management & Supporting Systems - Functionality and databases that track and report agency \noperational management, as well as the status of progress and accomplishments toward delivering the NRCS \nmission, both internal and external facing.  This aligns with the Management and Strategy Deputy Area. \n7. Natural Resource Document Management Systems \u2013 Functionality and systems that manage the storage, \nsearching, routing, records management and the digital use of critical agency documents and information \ninternally and externally.  This aligns with the Management and Strategy Deputy Area.", "1.3 FPAC Information Solutions Division \nThe FPAC Information Solutions Division (ISD) is led by the FPAC Assistant Chief Information O\ufb03cer and has six \nbranches: Information Assurance, Service Strategy and Planning, Customer Needs Management, Business \nOperations, Service Delivery and Operations, and Geospatial Enterprise Operations. \nThe Service Strategy and Planning Branch conducts IT strategic planning in alignment with Departmental \ndirection, formulates IT policies and procedures in support of Department and industry standards, and provides \nstrategic and tactical architectural and design guidance throughout the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). \nThe Information Assurance Branch manages an information assurance awareness program, access controls, and \ninformation assurance incidents and events. The branch is also responsible for implementing an IT Privacy \nProgram, in consultation with the Department and Agency Privacy O\ufb03cer. \nThe Customer Needs Management Branch establishes, manages, and maintains strategic relationships with FPAC \nstakeholders and customers to de\ufb01ne FPAC business roadmaps and requirements. The branch also de\ufb01nes IT \nproject management methodologies, policies, and procedures; and provides project managers across ISD for \nsoftware and solution delivery projects. The Business Operations Branch manages execution of the FPAC IT \ncapital investment budget and oversees FPAC IT contracts and agreements in adherence with Departmental and \nOMB policy and guidance.  \nThe Service Delivery and Operations Branch (SDOB) develops, con\ufb01gures, tests, implements and maintains high-\nquality IT services and solutions to ful\ufb01ll FPAC mission requirements. SDOB provides leadership and direction in \nthe administration of ISD operational infrastructure environments, databases, tools, and services including data \nwarehousing and business intelligence environments. Additionally, the branch serves as the primary point of \ncontact with USDA service providers, such as the USDA Client Experience Center (CEC) and USDA Digital \nInfrastructure Services Center (DISC) to manage FPAC infrastructure and end user computing needs. Within \nSDOB, the Conservation Section delivers IT services and solutions supporting the NRCS lines of business.  \nThe Geospatial Enterprise Operations (GEO) Branch [enter information about the GEO organization/operating \nmodel here] \n1.4 FPAC Office of the Assistant Chief Data Officer \nFPAC established a centralized analytics team, O\ufb03ce of the Assistant Chief Data O\ufb03cer, (ACDO) which helped \nestablish a framework for long-term adoption and management of analytics across the mission area. The \nestablishment of ACDO has assessed organizational structures as well as the data infrastructure to provide \ninsight into how FPAC can better position itself for long-term, sustained success in the areas of data & analytics. \nACDO oversees establishing mature data governance processes and stewardship.  \nThe ACDO team identi\ufb01es and helps solve major cross-cutting strategic questions by bringing the use of data \nanalysis and advance data analytics techniques and methods to bare.  This includes machine learning and \narti\ufb01cial intelligence.  The ACDO team also provides oversight on the creation of analytics products such as data \nvisualization, scenario analysis tools, and prescriptive/predictive models to draw insight from Mission Areas\u2019 vast \ndata- structured, semi-structured data and unstructured, for day-to-day use by business leaders.  NRCS and \nConservation Branch will be supported by the ACDO team to cultivate a data-driven organization through the \ndevelopment and enablement of their workforce (fostering and championing data science training and sourcing \ntalent in support of and/or NRCS).  The team will work with NRCS to formulate and align overall Mission Area \ndata strategy and data governance in partnership with NRCS leadership and Information Solutions Division. \nEnsuring data is easily accessible yet secure, is of high quality and can be transformed into new formats and \nknowledge.   \nACDO team will oversee the planning, review and implementation of data/analytics platforms and tools across \nthe mission area to improve links between siloed databases and data stores that NRCS needs to support their \nbusiness operations.  They will coordinate with the USDA Chief Data O\ufb03cer on NRCS and other FPAC Agencies \nbehalf to enable open data, participate in inter-Departmental activities and ensure that relevant data is readily \navailable, easily found and easily reusable across the Department.  \nACDO team will closely work with the department on help achieving department wide data goals and help \ndevelop planning the roadmap and strategies. ACDO team will develop Data and AI strategies for mission area \nand partner with agencies on the implementation of the tactical outcome of those strategies. \n1.5 Conservation Information Technology Services \nUSDA recognizes that conservation by farmers, ranchers and forest owners today means thriving and sustainable \nagriculture for our future. Seventy percent of the nation's land is privately owned, and conservation of our \nnation's private lands not only results in healthy soil, water, air, plants, animals, and ecosystems, it also provides \nproductive and sustainable working lands.  \nThe ISD Conservation Section, ISD GEO branch, and O\ufb03ce of the ACDO work to provide IT and geospatial services \nsupporting NRCS lines of business. IT service delivery is supported by multiple federal contracts for IT services \nand products including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), commercial-o\ufb00-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, software \napplication development and maintenance, production application hosting support, security services, quality \nassurance testing, and helpdesk services.  Federal employees and contractors work collaboratively across \norganizational and contract boundaries to deliver integrated services seamlessly and e\ufb00ectively. NRCS program \nsuccess relies on a delivery-focused approach to providing IT services. \n1.5.1 Business Capability and IT Modernization Roadmaps \nNRCS maintains a Business Capability Roadmap a to de\ufb01ne, prioritize, and approve work supporting NRCS IT \nservice delivery by value stream.  Work is de\ufb01ned by epic, a collection of related features.  The Business \nCapability Roadmap establishes priorities by value stream for a rolling three-year period and may include set \ndelivery dates for some epics based on NRCS program delivery needs.  The current NRCS Business Capability \nRoadmap (attachment X) is included in the performance work statement for reference and to help the contractor \nunderstand the current NRCS business vision. \nISD maintains a three-year IT Modernization Roadmap which aligns to the USDA Modernization Roadmap.  The IT \nModernization Roadmap guides IT delivery approaches and in\ufb02uences the NRCS Business Capability Roadmap \npriorities.  Some IT modernization goals work towards set delivery dates based on USDA-wide targets.  Other IT \nmodernization goals foster a continual focus on modern IT delivery. \nThe roadmaps are maintained dynamically, reviewed and re-prioritized quarterly, and work is authorized by the \nNRCS Investment Review Board annually. The NRCS Investment Review Board may authorize additional work \nduring the year based on emerging or evolving business priorities or IT modernization impacts.  All work \nauthorized under a roadmap drives toward achievement of the value stream future state de\ufb01ned in the \nperformance work statement.   \n1.5.2 Integrated Components \nDelivery of IT services supporting NRCS lines of business requires cohesive integration of multiple federal and \ncontractor teams.  USDA uses Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to provide a framework for integration and \nexecution of Agile software delivery services.   \n1.5.2.1 Solution Agile Release Train \nThe Solution Agile Release Train (ART) adds value to NRCS by facilitating and improving the overall Conservation \nSolution strategy to ensure alignment with NRCS and Business requirements.

The Contractor shall adhere to the coordination, \nintegration, and communication requirements described in this performance work statement in support of the \ncommon delivery cadence.   \n3.3.1 Coordination and Collaboration \nThe Contractor shall coordinate with multiple stakeholders across the Conservation team including the \nGovernment Business Owner, Government Product Owner, Government Program Manager, other business and \ntechnical federal stakeholders, and other federal and contractor teams.  FPAC requires all parties to work \nalongside each other in a collaborative environment creating a quintessentially gray badge environment. We are \nall part of one team supporting NRCS mission delivery. The Contractor shall embody a highly collaborative and \ncooperative attitude to enable positive interaction with the Government and other Contractors to avoid \nduplication of e\ufb00ort and to ensure the coordination of work e\ufb00orts.  \nThe Contractor shall coordinate with the Solution Train to plan, align e\ufb00orts, and provide accurate and veri\ufb01able \nmetrics during pre-planning, PI planning, and PI execution. The Solution Train team, with Government Program \nManager and COR approval, may establish or try-out common measures, standards, guardrails, or capacity \nforecasting methods across all ARTs.  The Contractor shall adopt and support these portfolio-wide e\ufb00orts. \nCoordination between the Solution Train team and each ART\u2019s Release Train Engineer must support scrum \nmasters, product owners, and business owners identifying, grooming, prioritizing, and approving user stories to \nde\ufb01ne the work performed during a PI.  \nThe Government Business Owner and Government Program Manager provide guidance on the vision, \nrequirements, and priority of work and validate the delivered IT solution meets the acceptance criteria as \nde\ufb01ned in the PI plan. The Contractor Program Manager shall work closely with the Government Program \nManager. The Government Program Manager provides technical oversight in close coordination with the COR \nwho provides contract oversight. The Contractor shall NOT take technical direction related to deliverables or \nservices under the PWS from anyone other than the Government Program Manager in concert with the COR. \nOnly the Contracting O\ufb03cer may adjust contractual terms and conditions including changes to deliverable \nde\ufb01nitions, acceptance of non-compliant deliverables, consideration for potential government delays, and \ninvoice schedule changes.  \nThe Contractor Program Manager and Release Train Engineer are responsible for managing issues and \nimpediments for/within all teams within the ART including establishing an escalation path for the ART. The \nGovernment recommends but does not direct the following escalation path: \n\u2022 Person to Person \n\u2022 Person to Scrum Master \n\u2022 Person to Release Train Engineer (RTE) \n\u2022 Person to Agile Coach \n\u2022 Person to Solution Train Engineer (STE)  \n\u2022 Person to Contractor Program Manager \n\u2022 Person or Contractor Program Manager to Government Program Manager (GPM) \n\u2022 Contractor Program Manager and/or Government Program Manager to COR \n3.3.2 Program Cadence and Synchronization \nConservation IT service delivery leverages Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles and organization.  Portfolio-\nwide planning uses a common delivery cadence consisting of synchronized iterations and PIs.  The Government \nde\ufb01nes the portfolio-wide iteration schedule with input from contractors. The program of work is segmented \ninto 12 or 14-week PIs (PI) consisting of \ufb01ve or six 2-week development iterations and one 2-week Innovation \nand Planning Iteration.  PIs and iterations are synchronized across teams by aligning the teams\u2019 schedule.  The PI \nand Iteration schedule is coordinated by the Solution Train Team.   \n3.3.2.1 PI Planning \nDuring the last iteration of a PI, the Contractor shall meet with the Government and other Conservation Program \ncomponents to plan the next PI.  This event is referred to as PI Planning, or PI Planning, and usually occurs over a \nfour-day period with a \ufb01fth day for the Solution-level sync.  The Government will provide a list of prioritized \nfeatures that are fully de\ufb01ned with acceptance criteria.  The Contractor development teams shall plan the \ndelivery of the features collaboratively with the Government Product Owner(s).  The teams will plan to deliver \nfunctioning software or systems by implementing the features through user stories during the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve iterations \nof the upcoming PI.  The last iteration, known as the Innovation and Planning Iteration, is reserved for the next PI \nPlanning session and application maintenance activities such as defect \ufb01xes, refactoring code, implementing \ninfrastructure enablers, innovation spikes, etc.   \n3.3.2.2 Features, User Stories and Relative Estimating \nIn preparation for PI Planning, the ART scrum teams de\ufb01ne and prioritize features and estimate the size of each \nfeature using relative estimation. The Contractor shall decompose features into user stories, an activity that may \noccur prior to PI Planning or during PI Execution. The Contractor shall provide a feature and user story sizing and \nprioritizing methodology that follows the standard Agile and SAFe\u00ae practice of using relative estimates generated \nby the team and captured in story points by assessing the quantity of work, the work complexity, the degree to \nwhich the solution is known, and the amount of uncertainty contained in features and user stories during PI \nplanning and con\ufb01rmed in sprint planning. Point estimation must be normalized across an ART\u2019s teams so that as \nestimates roll up into features, the ART has a shared basis for economic decision-making. Prior to estimation, the \nContractor shall work with the Government Product Owner to capture su\ufb03cient detail of the features and \nstories, so the team can estimate the story points, but not so much detail that it sti\ufb02es the conversation \nsurrounding the features and stories.  \n3.3.2.3 Program Increment Plan and Business Objectives \nDuring PI planning, the Contractor shall coordinate with the Government Business Owner and Government \nProgram Manager to create a PI Plan that identi\ufb01es features to be completed during the PI and dependencies \nwith the Government, other contractors, and external parties. The features that the teams plan to deliver during \nthe PI will be captured in the Team Backlog within the FPAC requirements management tool.  In addition to \nplanning the iterations, the teams shall coordinate dependencies with each other and external parties.   \nTeam capacity per iteration is an estimation of a team\u2019s capability to perform and deliver value. The Contractor \nshall de\ufb01ne the PI Plan based on adjusted team capacity.  Adjusted team capacity considers factors such as \nresource availability (holidays, leave schedules) and guardrails to promote quality and address emergent O&M \nneeds.  The Government historically used 10% of team capacity as a guideline, but the Contractor shall establish \nappropriate guardrails to ensure delivery of functioning software features at the end of the PI per the \nGovernment\u2019s program delivery deadlines.   \nTeam velocity is a measurement of demonstrated performance from previous iterations. The government \nrecognizes that velocity is a backward-looking metric, is exclusively owned by each development team, and \nprovides the team itself and the Product Owner with an indication of how much work can be done within one \nSprint (for that speci\ufb01c team). The Government will consider team velocity trends (increasing, maintaining, or \ndecreasing) when assessing risk to product delivery schedules.   \nAfter the teams fully allocate their capacity for the PI with features, the teams shall create a list of Business \nObjectives that shall be achieved when they deliver the planned features.  A business objective may be \ncomprised of multiple features. The teams will then commit to delivering those business objectives at the end of \nPI Planning.  Teams shall designate any objectives that contain a lot of risk or uncertainty as uncommitted or \nstretch objectives.  The business owners or their designees shall assign a business value to each objective, \nrepresenting the relative value of the objective to the business.  The list of committed team objectives and \nuncommitted team objectives and their corresponding business values are a deliverable to the government at \nthe end of PI Planning in the form of a document or power point slide with the associated features and program \nepics documented in the Government\u2019s designated requirements management tool.  \nDuring PI Planning, the Contractor and the government shall identify risks to successfully delivering the \nobjectives for the PI.  The Contractor shall work collaboratively with the government on risk management until \neach of the risks are Resolved, Owned, Accepted, or Mitigated (ROAM\u2019 d).   \nAt the conclusion of PI Planning, the Contractor shall deliver a PI Plan including (a) adjusted capacity by team, (b) \nlist of features to be delivered, (c) dependencies, (d) risks, and (e) backlog of committed and uncommitted \nbusiness objectives with associated business values.  The Contractor shall document backlog features, epics, and \nobjectives in the Government\u2019s designated requirements management tool.   \nDeliverables: \nA017 Program Increment Plan", "3.3.3 Program Increment Execution \n3.3.3.1 Iteration Planning \nIteration planning will be performed at the beginning of each iteration, in collaboration with the Government \nProduct Owner.  At iteration planning, the teams shall ensure that features are being completed according to the \napproved acceptance criteria and review the program epics completion status. The approved features for the PI \nwill be decomposed into user stories. The Contractor shall commit to user stories to be delivered during the \niteration in accordance with the capacity estimation methods. The committed User Stories shall be contained \nwithin the Team Backlog and Iteration Boards in the FPAC requirements management tool.", "3.3.3.2 Iteration Demonstrations \nAt the end of each iteration, the Contractor shall demonstrate the work performed against the feature and story \nacceptance criteria during the iteration to the Government Product Owners. In the event the Government \nProduct Owner desires changes or additions to the work performed and demonstrated to achieve the business \nvalue for the features and objectives, the change shall be managed by adding the changes required to the \nProgram Backlog and prioritized accordingly for the next iteration and/or increment.  The iteration \ndemonstration and approval of features demonstrates evidence of progress towards feature delivery.", "3.3.3.3 Iteration Retrospectives \nEach iteration, the teams shall perform a team retrospective for the iteration.  The teams shall identify what \nprocesses worked well and should be continued.

If the SCRM Review Board has not responded by the \u201ccritical \ndate\u201d, the CO may decide without the SCRM Review Board\u2019s input. \n2) Resources for assisting the CO in making this determination, based on previous guidance provided by \nGSA\u2019s SCRM Review Board, will be available on the Acquisition Portal athttp://insite.gsa.gov/scrm. \n3) If, after using such resources, the CO cannot make this determination on their own, the CO should \nconsult with their acquisition team, technical experts, their management, and request additional \nassistance from the SCRM Review Board by contacting SCRM-Review-Board@gsa.gov. \n4) If the CO determines that continued performance or extension of the contract (or order) will not result in \na violation of the prohibition, the CO should document the \ufb01le accordingly and may continue \nperformance of and/or extend the contract (or order).", "5.1.5.6.2 Exceptions Clarification  \nThe statute includes two exceptions at 889 (a)(2)(A) and (B).

(2) The exception at 889(a)(2)(B) allows an entity \nto procure \u201ctelecommunications equipment that cannot route or redirect user data tra\ufb03c or [cannot] permit \nvisibility into any user data or packets that such equipment transmits or otherwise handles.\u201d The exception \nallowing for procurement of services that connect to the facilities of a third-party, such as backhaul, roaming, \nor interconnection arrangements applies only to a Government agency that is contracting with an entity to \nprovide a service. Therefore, the exception does not apply to a contractor\u2019s use of a service that connects to \nthe facilities of a third-party, such as backhaul, roaming, or interconnection arrangements. As a result, the \nFederal Government is prohibited from contracting with a contractor that uses covered telecommunications \nequipment or services to obtain backhaul services from an internet service provider, unless a waiver is granted.", "5.1.5.7 Environmental Risks  \nWithout proper risk aversion strategies, the supply chains can be disrupted by environmental factors; therefore, \nall the environment-related legislation made by governments and other regulatory bodies should be followed.  \nNegative environmental impacts such as carbon emissions can be reduced; waste must be disposed of properly; \nand chemicals handled properly to protect the environment. To avoid the dangers of natural disasters, \nContractor or Sub-Contractor must choose their location and mode of transport strategically. They should be \n\ufb02exible and responsive enough to absorb changes and capable enough to avoid any distortions in the supply \nchain.", "5.1.6 C-SCRM Appendices \n5.1.6.1 Contractor or Sub-Contractor Cybersecurity Policy/System Security Plan \nContractor will provide to USDA the Contractor\u2019s cybersecurity policy or System Security Plan.
