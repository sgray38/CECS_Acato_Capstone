1.0 BACKGROUND 
The mission of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology 
(OIT) is to collaborate with business partners to create the best experience for Veterans. In 
meeting these goals, OIT strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information 
Technology (IT) services to those who provide care to Veterans at point-of-care as well as 
throughout all points of each Veteran’s health care, in an effective, timely and compassionate 
manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to 
meet mission goals. 
 
OIT is the steward of VA’s IT resources and is responsible for ensuring the efficient and 
effective operation of VA’s IT Management System to meet mission requirements defined by the 
VA Secretary and other key VA officials.  OIT partners with other VA business units to deliver 
available, adaptable, secure, and cost-effective technology services to VA. Technology services 
are introduced into VA via two primary approaches: in-house development or acquisition of 
Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and Government Off The Shelf (GOTS). These approaches 
follow industry, Government, and VA standards for technology, including but not limited to the 
phases of Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) for development and Software Acquisition, 
Configuration, and Implementation (SACI) for COTS and GOTS. 
 
OIT provides a consolidated enterprise-wide approach to identify, select, prioritize, and 
successfully execute a portfolio of IT Services.  OIT further provides management and oversight 
for major IT initiatives, to improve project execution and deliver better outcomes to internal and 
external business partners and to Veterans.  
 
Within OIT and reporting to the VA’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information and 
Technology, is the IT Service area Compliance, Risk, and Remediation (CRR) wherein 
Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Test Management and Operations (TMO) and 
the Test Center (TC) reside. At present, the services provided by IV&V support many internal 
and external customers. The two primary customers internal to VA are: 1) OIT’s Software 
Product Management (SPM), an OIT IT Service area which maintains VA’s Legacy and some 
modernization Products, and 2) the Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office 
(EHRM-IO), which is a VA major Program office responsible for the implementation of VA’s 
modernization of their Electronic Health Record (EHR). The VA Supply Chain Modernization 
(SCM) program is a VA Program office that may require testing activities under this contract.   
SCM will acquire and implement department-wide supply chain solutions, and after various 
research and assessments have concluded may become a customer engaging these services. 
 
As the VA champion for IT quality and a risk-based approach to software testing, IV&V TMO & 
TC provides testing services and test environments enabling EHRM-IO and OIT program and 
project managers to deliver and deploy stable, high quality information technology solutions on-
time and within budget.  
 
While engaging in partnerships with the EHRM-IO, OIT organizations, VA administrations, and 
other external agencies, TMO and TC measures and examines delivery and deployment 
processes, quality, and capabilities within VA to enable a culture of continuous improvement. 
This culture leads to enhanced program and project quality through early engagement in

development or acquisition lifecycles, agile delivery of test services and test environments, and 
elimination of process redundancy.  
 
Strategic priorities include: 
• Align resources and capabilities with VA mission-critical priorities. 
• Communicate, collaborate, and operate transparently with internal and external 
stakeholders, examples include: EHRM-IO Integrated Testing, OIT CRR, OIT SPM, OIT 
Infrastructure Operations Service (IOS), OIT leadership, and the U.S. Department of 
Defense (DoD). 
• Promote a flexible and adaptive culture that leverages quality metrics and analytics to 
optimize services delivery. 
• Continuously improve existing core and supporting business processes and services and 
develop new processes and services as VA and OIT priorities evolve. 
• Commit to service excellence through open communication and early engagement with 
customers. 
 
Independent Verification & Validation TMO & TC are the OIT organization that provides the 
services through this contract primarily for the independent test and evaluation of software 
applications within the OIT portfolio.  EHRM-IO Integrated Testing is the organization that 
utilizes TMO and TC services through this contract for the independent test and evaluation of the 
capabilities and solutions that make up the electronic medical record.  
 
On May 17, 2018, VA entered into a ten-year indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract 
with Cerner Government Services, Inc. (Cerner now Oracle Health) to acquire the Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) system being deployed by the Department of Defense (DoD) and related 
services for deployment and transition across the VA enterprise in a manner that meets the VA’s 
needs and enables seamless healthcare to Veterans and qualified beneficiaries. Procurement of a 
single, common system across VA and DoD will achieve VA’s goal of seamless care for 
Veterans by facilitating the transition of active-duty military members to VA and improving their 
timely access to the highest quality of care.   
 
The Oracle Health EHR solution shall provide VA with a single system that can store and 
retrieve administrative, clinical, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, and scheduling data, and 
interact with other internal and external systems. Modernization of VA’s EHR will support a 
Veteran-centric, team-based care model, with modern decision support tools; clinical information 
content services; identification, communication and standardization of care paths; and resource 
provisioning. This will improve interoperability, performance, and user experience for a majority 
of the health care delivery and ancillary teams responsible for directly or indirectly providing 
health care services; and in turn will improve quality, safety, and timeliness of health care 
services delivered to Veterans.    
 
Oracle Health provides a comprehensive EHR solution and services. The VA Electronic Health 
Record Modernization Integration Office (EHRM-IO) and the DoD Healthcare Management 
System Modernization (DHMSM) are moving to a joint release management of two release 
cycles per year and releases of site-specific capabilities with the EHRM-IO site deployments.  
EHRM-IO Integrated Testing (IntT) is the champion for EHRM-IO end-to-end IT quality and

testing through the provision of software quality assurance (SQA) software testing environments, 
testing and evaluation services, and software development projects. IntT collaborates with the 
program and project managers to support them in the delivery and deployment of high-quality, 
stable, interoperable IT solutions to reduce risk and minimize the impact of production defects to 
the provided Veteran services. 
 
The EHRM-IO Program is the program executive office charged with the preparation, 
deployment, and transition to a new electronic health record (EHR) within VA.  The program 
will ensure that the process of deploying the new EHR is done in a manner that meets VA needs 
and supports seamless healthcare to Veterans and qualified beneficiaries.  The Integrated Testing 
program within the EHRM-IO manages and oversees the execution of the test and evaluation 
activities across the EHRM program and its products.  The testing community that makes up the 
EHRM-IO Integrated Testing Program is comprised of three main organizations: Integrated 
Testing Enterprise Test (IntT-ET), Office of Functional Champion, Functional Test & Evaluation 
(OFC Test/OFCt), and the Oracle Health Testing & Quality Assurance (T&QA).  The resources 
delivering these services are a mix of EHRM-IO IntT VA resources and IntT-ET contractor 
services through this IETSS contract; OFC Test VA & EHRM-IO contractor resources; and OIT 
TMO and TC VA resources.   
 
The IETSS Contract will provide services in support of EHRM-IO IntT and OFC Test and OIT 
TMO and TC VA resources. IETSS resources will provide services that work closely and 
collaboratively with the Oracle Health T&QA team to ensure an integrated approach and 
schedule for the EHRM-IO Test and Evaluation lifecycle.    
 
Historically, VA developed software applications in house, so the main operational focus for 
TMO and TC was to provide test environments and test services for VA-developed applications.  
In mid-2017, VA announced a major shift from internally developed software applications to 
modernization efforts, which includes a significant use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 
products.  A key element of VA modernization is the effort to replace VA’s current EHR system, 
the Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), with a COTS product. 
For purposes of this PWS, the VA EHR solution will be referred to as the VA Electronic Health 
Record Modernization system (EHRM). 
 
EHRM is based on the electronic health record solution provided to the Department of Defense 
(DoD) and is known as the Military Health System GENESIS, which is based on Oracle Health 
Millennium.  The adoption of a single joint system between VA and DoD will enable patient 
data to reside in a common system with a seamless link between DoD, VA, and community 
providers.  When implemented, the EHR System will provide access to authoritative clinical data 
sources; as the transition matures, it will become the authoritative source of clinical data to 
support improved population health, patient safety, and quality of care provided by VA.

1.1 OIT IV&V TMO AND TC & EHRM-IO INTEGRATED TESTING 
FUNCTIONAL AREAS 
OIT IV&V and EHRM-IO IntT perform services in the following major functional areas: 
 
1.1.1 Test Management and Operations 
Test Management and Operations (TMO) Associate Directorate serves as the software 
testing operations, monitoring, risk assessment, test planning & deliver, and test process 
management for IETSS.  TMO is comprised of 4 key branches.     
 
1.1.1.1 Operations and Management 
Operations and Management (O&M) is a part of TMO, and supports all budget planning, 
funding execution, testing software and hardware acquisitions and maintenance activities for 
both TMO and TC, as well as EHRM-IntT and other major customers that may arise.  O&M is 
predominantly resourced by VA government staff, and utilizes process management, knowledge 
management and reporting support. 
 
1.1.1.2 Test and Evaluation 
Test & Evaluation (T&E) are part of TMO. T&E are comprised of a multitude of teams, 
delivering analysis and testing services to the EHRM-IO Program and OIT. T&E teams analyze 
VA application requirements and COTS stakeholder project requirements to identify 
opportunities for increase in quality and reduction of risks. Informed from such analysis, T&E 
testing services teams recommend performing diverse software testing services.  
 
The T&E analysis team are comprised of the initial forward-facing representatives in 
engagements with customers and analysts who conduct a methodical risk-based review and 
scoring of identified project requirements and other associated characteristics of a project or 
system.  The analysis team collaborates with all internal and external parties during an 
engagement to identify appropriate testing services. The T&E analysis team then creates and 
provides a recommended course of action to engage the customer and prepare for delivery of the 
tailored suite of testing services unique to the software product. 
 
The T&E testing services delivery team coordinates within the TMO/EHRM-IO IntT 
teams (including IV&V Test Center), and OIT SPM software project teams to establish testing 
environments, emulate interfacing systems, manage resources, and create and improve efficient 
repeatable processes.  T&E provides skilled and experienced leadership, technical subject matter 
experts, testing engineers, and technicians to execute a vast array of software testing, including 
but not limited to Test Observation and Validation (TOV), interoperability testing, system 
integration (interface) testing (SIT), data migration, Risk-based Requirements Validation (RV) 
testing, performance testing (benchmarking, load, ramp-up, stress, endurance, spike), 
mobile/portable application testing, exploratory testing, static and dynamic Software Code 
Quality Check (SCQC) scanning and reporting. T&E also supports user acceptance testing and 
user functional testing of software development, COTS acquisition, and implementation 
programs. The primary example of which is providing testing resources through this IETSS 
contract for EHRM-IO Integrated Testing requirements.

1.1.1.3 Testing Technology Support 
Testing Technology Support provides testing and technology support for both OIT testing & 
EHRM-IO IntT and major programs. Services include architecture, interoperability, VistA Data 
Service (VDS), creation & maintenance of tools to support high volume data migration testing, 
and service virtualization functionality. TTS provides test environment logical requirements, 
architecture diagrams, test data, service virtual components, and configuration of test 
environments for TMO testing projects.  
 
1.1.1.4 Test Process and Quality Management 
Test Process and Quality Management (TPQM) is focused on continuous review and 
improvement of testing capabilities and services provided by TMO, TC and EHRM-IO 
Integrated Testing. TPQM also directs the establishment of a system-wide definition and 
approach for executing services for all VA projects requiring testing services from TMO and TC, 
to include establishing and tracking metrics and measures, continuous review and improvement 
of processes, and artifact review. The focus of TPQM is ensuring that standardization and quality 
assurance processes are used within the OIT and EHRM IntT testing program. TPQM resources 
serve as process consultants and subject matter experts on the VA Testing Process and assist 
project teams with understanding the various testing processes and how they are performed 
throughout the SDLC and SACI phases. TPQM resources work closely with the 
portfolio/program management offices, project teams, and other VA stakeholders to define and 
improve the Software Quality Assurance program. The Testing Logistics Support (TLS) team 
within TPQM supports the day-to-day operation of IV&V & ERHM-IO IntT and provides 
structure to assist in the strategic and tactical planning necessary to accomplish IV&V 
management goals. TLS coordinates work plans and schedules with IV&V& EHRM-IO IntT 
managers and customers to provide testing environments and services in a manner that promotes 
a smooth flow of projects while ensuring an effective distribution of resources. Work performed 
by TPQM also results in constant monitoring of priorities, identifying the need for changes when 
appropriate and acting when necessary to implement changes.  
 
1.1.2 Test Center 
Test Center (TC) Associate Directorate serves as the test environment and infrastructure 
operations oversight for IETSS.  TC is comprised of a key branch.     
 
1.1.2.1 Testing Systems Engineering and Implementation, the Testing Systems 
Engineering and Implementation (TSEI) team provides the software, hardware, and 
physical plant infrastructure to support environments needed for testing activities, 
including but not limited to enterprise-level software testing, EHRM-IO Integrated 
Testing program testing, and OIT SPM project team testing (including project-level 
integration testing, development testing, and operations support for environments and 
systems). The Test Center (TC) Infrastructure is housed at the Bay Pines Office of 
Information and Technology Field Office, 10000 Bay Pines Blvd, Building 37, Bay Pines, 
FL 33744. Additionally, TSEI supports the T&E analysis team in identifying the 
criticality and risks for technical requirements (as needed) and provides risk assessment 
on the product architecture. The goal is to expand TC infrastructure as needed to support 
an increasing number of testing environments, which in turn increases testing capability 
that TMO can provide to project teams.

1.2 OIT SERVICES AND METHODOLOGY 
IV&V TMO and TC is involved early and throughout all SDLC and SACI phases, currently via 
the VA OIT Veteran-focused Integration Process (VIP) methodology and/or the current 
Acquisition Lifecycle Framework (ALF), although TMO and TC evolves to accommodate 
methodology improvements and changes. TMO assists project teams with understanding all 
aspects of the OIT and EHRM-IO Test Processes, especially those that apply to individual 
projects. TMO also reviews all identified project requirements to analyze for level of risk, advise 
on testability, determine special hardware/environment needs for test planning, completes testing 
intake assessments (TIA) entrance criteria with project team collaboration, performs testing 
intake assessments, and performs T&E services. 
 
OIT follows VIP Agile and software acquisition, configuration, and implementation (SACI) 
methodology for development and management of IT projects. VIP is a Lean-Agile framework 
that provides efficient streamlining of activities within the VA enterprise and is designed to 
increase the delivery speed of high-quality and secure IT capabilities. VIP methodologies are 
reviewed on a recurring basis and refinements are made as needed. TMO stays abreast of all the 
latest changes to the VIP methodologies that is maintained in PAL (Process Asset Library). 
Major program SACI processes tend to align with standard VA OIT processes to include VIP, 
and may streamline, expand, augment, or customize those VIP processes to meet program needs.  
 
IV&V Test Management Operations & Test Center engagement starts with gathering project data 
for the Testing Intake Assessment (TIA). In the case of OIT, the primary authoritative source for 
approved and budgeted projects is VA PARS. When a new entry or new build on an existing 
entry are established, TMO engagement begins.  TMO evaluates the VIP Request (VIPR), data 
elements, and project artifacts to recommend TMO testing services. During product/build start, 
TMO performs the Criticality Analysis and Risk Assessment (CARA) and recommends 
appropriate test services. During the remainder of the project lifecycle, TMO monitors product 
and sprint backlogs in project repositories, with follow-on CARA’s performed and 
recommendations of further applicable testing services. TMO conducts testing services in 
parallel with the project build. 
 
TMO processes include reviewing the project artifacts, conducting an initial outreach meeting, 
project analysis, planning, and testing service determination. When the services start, TMO 
determines whether test environments exist which could be used for the services, or new ones are 
built. From there, TMO executes testing, and generates reports of the test findings. TMO also 
may conduct final regression testing following a project’s Initial Operating Capability (IOC).  
TMO continues to monitor product and sprint backlogs until project closeout. 
 
There are two primary entrances into TMO testing service engagement with a Program and/or 
Project. One is through a Program and/or Project entering a request into TMO’s centralized 
request management tool for testing services. The other is a proactive approach to monitoring the 
authoritative source for approved VA projects, both for new entries and software builds within 
existing entries. TMO engages with the VA project manager (PM) or designee to gain access to 
the product teams repositories.  TMO conducts a high-level evaluation on all the artifacts. After 
the evaluation, if further engagement is not recommended, TMO enters a passive engagement. If 
TMO's engagement is recommended, a build-level risk assessment following TMO’s CARA

process is conducted. TMO recommended services accepted and scheduled with the project are 
performed against the current build and sprint based on the build-level CARA at the discretion of 
the project or program team. If there are additional builds, TMO continues to perform build-level 
CARAs and any recommended test services accepted by the Program and/or Project that result 
for those builds until there are no additional builds, at which point TMO enters a passive 
engagement. 
 
For all VIP methodologies, TMO uses a risk-based approach to determine what T&E services are 
recommended. This approach involves using a standardized methodology to determine the level 
of testing for software applications based on risks and their probable adverse impacts to the 
enterprise. As part of the TIA process, the CARA methodology identifies the functions, system 
design elements, or software tasks which pose the greatest risk to the success of software 
development initiatives. The key feature of this approach is the assessment of an appropriate 
level of analysis for any given function based on risk and criticality. By applying CARA, 
suitable levels of analysis, as well as the resources required to perform them can be clearly 
defined and implemented. The services offered by TMO fit into the SDLC and SACI phases and 
processes of planning, execution, and monitoring and control. The following diagram portrays 
how the TMO service offerings fit into the planning and execution lifecycle phases.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.2-3: Service Offerings and the SDLC and SACI phases

1.2.1 Services Executed During SDLC and SACI Planning Phase 
Three TMO services—Testing Intake Assessment (TIA), Criticality Analysis and Risk 
Assessment (CARA), and Determine Scope and Services—are performed during the Planning 
phase of the SDLC and SACI phases for products and/or projects. Project teams create respective 
project documentation (epics, user stories, requirements traceability matrices, etc.) and load them 
into the appropriate document repositories.  
 
TMO’s Testing Intake Assessment starts by creating a Project Analysis Summary (PAS) record 
based off VA approved and budgeted projects within the VA’s authoritative source. TMO triages 
all projects in the authoritative source, using a predefined criteria to identify appropriateness for 
further engagement. Once criteria are met, TMO requests access to the document repositories. As 
access is granted and any available project documentation is able to undergo analysis via the TIA 
service, TMO creates a Build Analysis Summary (BAS) for the project build. At this build level, 
the CARA process is executed.  
 
From the CARA results, the Determine Scope and Services service is performed. This service 
involves multi-disciplinary analysis performed by all TMO teams. Once scope and services are 
identified, TMO create a Risk Analysis Summary (RAS) which is reviewed and approved by 
TMO VA Management. The RAS is the primary written communication to the project for TMO 
recommended test services. As applicable, TMO will conduct a debrief with the project team. 
Details of these services are identified in Section 5.0. 
 
1.2.2 Services Executed During SDLC and SACI Test Services Execution Phase  
After Risk Analysis Summary (RAS) delivery to the project team, applicable debriefs, and 
project acceptance of all or any of the recommended test services, TMO enters the Execution 
phase.  This Execution phase includes coordination with the project team to collect any further 
information, identify the approach for test environment, and to overcome any other technical 
challenges in preparation of TMO testing services to be performed. To formally document these 
interactions and planning efforts TMO creates Test Plan Summary (TPS), obtains TMO VA 
management concurrence and approval, and then delivers the TPS to the project team.  
  
Overlapping Planning and Execution is the TC Test Environment Construction. These 
requirements are defined by TC engineers and delivered to TC or the major program test 
environment managers (for COTS test systems hosted elsewhere) in the form of a Test 
Environment Logical Requirements (TELR) document.  TC and the major program 
representatives coordinate the creation of the test environments as necessary, and ensures the 
environment performs as expected via a smoke test.  TC and the major program representatives 
also may coordinate with the project team who validates the build is ready for TMO testing 
service execution such as Requirements Validation Testing, Performance Testing, System 
Integration/Interoperability Testing, and Software Code Quality Check (SCQC).  When the 
appropriate components of the system under test (SUT) are available for testing, the TMO team 
executes planned services and records the activities, findings and results in test service 
repositories. TMO then creates a Test Analysis Summary (TAS), which is reviewed and 
approved by TMO VA management. Once approved, the TAS is delivered to the project team

and a debriefing with the project team is conducted as applicable.  Details of these services are 
identified in section 5.   
 
1.2.3 Processes Executed in Support of Monitoring and Control 
Workload Forecasting and Support of Test Center Systems may be executed during the 
Monitoring and Control Phase of the SDLC and SACI phases. TMO management continuously 
checks VIPR and Test Center Service Requests so that appropriate plans can be made for 
providing test services and/or other TMO services. 
 
1.2.3.1 Workload Forecasting 
Workload Forecasting is the process in which information from the project team and TMO is 
used to forecast work for TMO.  TMO updates the testing project schedule to align with changes 
gathered from the Product/Project team’s Schedule. TMO uses the information to forecast 
project arrival and to project services which enables adequate time and resource preparation. 
 
1.2.3.2 Support of Test Center Systems 
TSEI maintains the TC located in Bay Pines, FL, which is used by various project teams for 
software product-level Quality Assurance testing, as well as hosting software tools and test 
environments built for delivery of TMO test services to OIT and major programs. TSEI also 
manages test systems hosted in VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) as needed. Services provided by 
the TC include: 
 
• Establishment of new databases 
• Assistance with miscellaneous issues when there is trouble with a test environment 
• Database restore/refresh/backup 
• User access to an environment 
• Install, configure, manage the SUT  
• Install, configure and manage the necessary test tools and monitoring tools  
 
In accordance with OIT priorities and timelines, IV&V TC will begin planning for transition to 
the cloud. 
1.3 EHRM-IO INTEGRATED TESTING SERVICES & METHODOLOGY 
The Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) Joint Master Test Plan (JMTP) 
documents the services and methodology used in the EHRM-IO Integrated Testing Program. The 
JMTP provides the overarching guidance to coordinate and execute integrated testing of the EHR 
that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) acquired from Oracle. Once deployed, the 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) will co-exist in the same production environment as the 
Department of Defense’s (DOD) EHR system with VA using an overlapping set of the DOD’s 
features as well as an additional set of features. 
 
The JMTP also describes the integrated testing lifecycle for the EHRM-IO Program executed 
across the test community. The test community is comprised of Oracle Testing & Quality 
Assurance (T&QA), deployment resources, EHRM-IO Integrated Testing (IntT) Enterprise Test 
(ET) resources, Office of the Functional Champion (OFC) Functional Testing and Evaluation

(OFCt) resources for medical enterprise and local system interfacing, the Office of Healthcare 
Technology Management (HTM) for medical devices and peripherals testing, field site subject
